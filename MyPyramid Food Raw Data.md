### My Pyramid Food Raw Data

_Why are these data interesting?_

Everyone needs food! It is very easy in our culture to slip into bad eating habits and much harder to change those habits to good. How 
do you make informed decisions? Arm yourself with data! This data contains many common food items, and some not so common food items, 
with nutritional information for multiple typical serving sizes. It will allow comparison of the relative benefits and dangers of a wide 
variety of food options.

_Description of data:_

This data consists of a 368KB zip file containing three tables of nutritional information including serving size, nutritional category, 
calories, solid fat, trans fat, added sugar, and alcohol content. The three tables include one of approximately 1000 general food items, 
ranging from fudgsicles to pickled beets and gin and tonic. One table consists of ‘foods needing condiments’ such as hotdogs or raw 
spinach, along with popular condiment choices for each, and the third table is the nutritional information for the condiments.

_Potential Users and Decision Makers:_

This information could be used in school cafeterias or after school programs to weigh the relative risks and benefits of various 
snack and meal options. The data could be similarly employed in any institutional food setting: nursing homes, corporate cafeterias, 
prisons, etc. 

_This data could answer these questions:_

1.	What condiments should be served to minimize added fats and/or sugars in a meal or snack?
2.	If a person has multiple bad habits, which should they focus on changing first? For example which adds more sugar to your 
diet: alcoholic beverages or candy? Which adds more fat: butter on your vegetables, or salad dressing?
3.	What are the nutritional components of a traditional American meal and what is a realistic but more healthy alternative?
