 # This plot shows that China's CO2 production has seen a sharp increase in the last decade and they produce, by far, the most CO2
 # emissions. China's growth looks like a steep exponential curve until approximately 2009, and for the last five years, while they 
 # are still exhibiting growth, the concavity of the curve changed direction, indicating a slower growth rate. 
 # The chart also shows that the USA's emissions are consistently much higher than the other countries in the top seven. 
 # India is also seeing rapid growth in CO2 emissions, going from 7th place in 1970 to third in 2014. 
 # Russia's data starts in 1990 (after the collapse of communism in 1989) 
 # Japan, Germany, and Great Britain have similar and relatively consistent emissions patterns, though Japan had a slight increase
 # while Germany had a decrease, causing them to switch places in the rankings.

# When considering per capita CO2 emissions, the USA is consistently significantly higher than any other country of the top 7 
# CO2 emissions producing countries. The USA, Germany, and Great Britain exhibit decreasing trend over time, while Japan and India
# are growing slowly, and China grew quite rapidly in the last two decades. Russia has not exhibited a consistent pattern, but their
# CO2 emissions per capita are consistently among the highest.
