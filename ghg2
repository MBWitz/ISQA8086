 # This plot shows that China's CO2 production has seen a sharp increase in the last decade and they produce, by far, the most CO2
 # emissions. China's growth looks like a steep exponential curve until approximately 2009, and for the last five years, while they 
 # are still exhibiting growth, the concavity of the curve changed direction, indicating a slower growth rate. 
 # The chart also shows that the USA's emissions are consistently much higher than the other countries in the top seven. 
 # India is also seeing rapid growth in CO2 emissions, going from 7th place in 1970 to third in 2014. 
 # Russia's data starts in 1990 (after the collapse of communism in 1989) 
 # Japan, Germany, and Great Britain have similar and relatively consistent emissions patterns, though Japan had a slight increase
 # while Germany had a decrease, causing them to switch places in the rankings.

 # These plots confirm that the disproportionately high rates of CO2 emissions in the United States and China cause the regions that
 # contain these countries to mirror their usage patterns.
 # Regions that are primarily made up of less industrial economies have much lower emissions overall and per capita, as would be
 # as expected. However, many of these regions are showing growth of their emissions, perhaps reflecting the relocation of much 
 # manufacturing out of industrialized nations like the USA into less developed economies with laxer environmental regulation.
