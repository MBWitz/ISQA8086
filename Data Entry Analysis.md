### Data Entry Analysis

#### 1. Problems with the data:

1. All data should be collected and stored in a consistent manner. These spreadsheets do not contain the same header names and
the data is not organized in the same manner. Examples:
>a. The first spreadsheet has a column called 'z' while the others have a column called 'depth.'  
>b. The first spreadsheet has a column called 'density' while the other two have 'Cuni #/L' and 'Chippo #/L.'  
>c. The first spreadsheet has species as a column and collects informtion for each species one after the other. The second and third
spreadsheets have separate columns for the separate species.  
>d. The spreadsheets all have different Tab names.  
>e. The spreadsheets themselves have different naming conventions, giving no indication of what data is within.   

2. The data is incomplete. Examples:
>a. The first spreadsheet has missing information.  
>b. The second spresdsheet has a block of missing data high-lighted in yellow with an asterik in the corner, but no note as to what the 
asterik means or why the data is missing.  
>c. There are data points listed in red, but no explanation for why they are red.  

3. Not enough information was recorded. Specifically, there are three measurements for each date, theoretically from different times of 
day, but there is no time listed for any data point. 

4. These spreadsheets contain some analysis that should not be included with the raw data. Examples:
>a. Two spreadsheet have graphs, one graphing date and temperature the other depth and Cuni.   
>b. One spreadsheet has some averages calculated in the corner.  
>c. One spreadsheet has some extra information, Max Depth and Max Secchi listed at the top.  

5. Metadata is not complete. Examples:
>a. Location of stations A and B. ('See  map in yellow notebook' is not sufficient)  
>b. Scales of measurement used are not listed. Is temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit? Is depth in meters?  
>c. Each column of data should have an explanation in the metadata including scale and accuracy for numeric data, and explanations of abreviations for nominal.  

#### 2. Suggested Formatting:

Date | Time | Station | Depth(m) | Temp(oC) | Species | Density(#/L) | Colony Size(mm) | Chla
