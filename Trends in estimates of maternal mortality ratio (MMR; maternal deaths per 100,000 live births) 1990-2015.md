### **Trends in estimates of maternal mortality ratio (MMR; maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) 1990-2015**

_Why are these data interesting?_

Most maternal mortality is preventable. While many areas have seen significant improvement, there are still too many maternal deaths. 
This data will allow people to observe trends in different countries, continents, and years, and compare changes. Merged with financial 
or geopolitical data one could  assess correlations between MMR and GDP, MMR and presence of war or conflict, or MMR and presence of 
public health care.

_Description of data:_

The data contains 190 rows and 8 columns including three letter country code, country name, and MMR per 100000 live births for each 
year between 1990 and 2015, multiples of five. It also contains a summary table of the same data by UNICEF region.

_Potential Users and Decision Makers:_

This data may be used by groups such as Doctors Without Borders, the Gates Foundation, and the United Nation to determine where to 
send resources, or what areas to study for effective practices. It may be used on a smaller scale for the same purposes for individual 
mission groups or medical communities sending members or students abroad.  

_This data could answer these questions:_

1)	Where have maternal mortality rates shown consistent improvement and where have those improvements been slower or non-existent?
2)	Is there a correlation between maternal mortality rate and access to public healthcare? This would require data about which 
countries have public healthcare and which do not.
3)	Is there a correlation between MMR and GDP? This would require GDP data for each of the given years for each country in the table.
